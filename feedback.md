/node_modules shouldn't be in your repo. Since these files are handled by npm and owned by third party developers, it's usually added to your `.gitignore` file. A better work flow, is to save the dependencies with `npm install gulp-jshint --save` or `npm install gulp-jshint --save-dev`. It looks like you did that for `gulp`. The next person to use your code the just does `npm install` and all dependencies are downloaded.
